# Shared Utilities Overview

This part of the documentation provides in-depth information about the reusable components, modules, and plugins within the OneSila Frontend project. Understanding these shared utilities is crucial for effective development and customization of the frontend.

## Components

The `components` directory contains a comprehensive collection of Vue.js components, which are the fundamental building blocks of the user interface. They are divided into four main categories for ease of understanding and use:

- **Atoms**: These are small, reusable UI components like buttons, icons, and inputs. They can be used independently and are the basic building blocks of the application.

- **Molecules**: Molecules are slightly more complex components that combine multiple atoms into functional UI segments, such as a search bar comprising an input field and a button.

- **Layouts**: This category includes components that assist in structuring the layout of the application, like grids and flex containers.

- **Organisms**: Organisms are complex UI components that form distinct sections of the application. They are composed of molecules and atoms, and represent complete functional units, like a navbar or a form.

Detailed documentation for each component can be found in their respective directories.

## Modules

Modules are JavaScript files that encapsulate specific functionalities of the application. They are essential for managing state, handling authentication, network requests, and other key functions. Some key modules in the project include:

- **Auth**: Manages authentication and user authorization.
- **Router**: Handles routing and navigation within the application.
- **Network**: Manages network requests and API communications.

Each module has its own documentation providing insights into its functionality and usage.

## Plugins

Plugins in the OneSila Frontend project extend the capabilities of the Vue.js framework, adding global functionalities that can be used across the application. These plugins include:

- **Vue Router**: For app routing.
- **Apollo Client**: For managing GraphQL queries.

Each plugin comes with its own set of configurations and is documented in the `plugins` directory.
