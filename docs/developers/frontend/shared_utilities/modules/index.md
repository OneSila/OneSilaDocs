# Modules Overview

## Description
Modules in Vue applications serve as reusable and encapsulated pieces of functionality. They can range from authentication mechanisms to device detection and messaging frameworks.

## Key Modules
1. **Auth**: Manages user authentication, session handling, and user-related properties.
2. **Device**: Detects and provides information about the client device, including size and type.
3. **Frame**: Handles messaging and events within embedded frames or between different contexts in the application.
4. **Keyboard**: Provides utilities for detecting specific keyboard events like 'Enter' and 'Shift+Enter' presses.
5. **Platform**: Detects the user's browser and platform, offering insights into the operating environment.
6. **Router**: Manages navigation and routing in the application, with advanced logic for access control based on authentication and user state.
7. **Screen**: Provides real-time information about the screen dimensions and detects various screen types (mobile, tablet, desktop).
8. **Toast**: Offers a notification system for displaying alerts, confirmations, and informational messages in a non-intrusive way.

Each module serves a specific purpose and is designed for easy integration and use across different parts of a Vue application.
