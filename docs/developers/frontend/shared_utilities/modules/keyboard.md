## Overview
The `Keyboard` module in Vue applications provides utilities for detecting specific keyboard events. It's designed to enhance user interaction by allowing developers to assign actions to key presses like 'Enter' and 'Shift+Enter'.

## Features
- Custom Keyboard Event Handling: Detects and responds to specific keyboard events.
- Lifecycle Integration: Seamlessly integrates with Vue's component lifecycle for adding and removing event listeners.

## Key Functions
- `onEnterPressed`: Sets a callback for the 'Enter' key press.
- `onShiftEnterPressed`: Configures a callback for the 'Shift+Enter' key press.
- `useEnterKeyboardListener`: Vue composition function for handling 'Enter' key press.
- `useShiftEnterKeyboardListener`: Vue composition function for managing 'Shift+Enter' key press events.

This module is essential for applications requiring custom keyboard interactions, enabling a more interactive and responsive user experience.
