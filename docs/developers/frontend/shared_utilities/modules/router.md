# Router Module Overview

## Description
The Router module orchestrates navigation and URL management in Vue.js applications. It is essential for defining application routes, handling URL state, and managing navigation flow, particularly in complex web applications.

## Key Functionalities
- **Comprehensive Route Management**: Organizes and manages various application routes including auth, profile, contacts, sales, purchasing, inventory, products, and settings.
- **Dynamic Navigation**: Facilitates dynamic route loading and component rendering, enhancing user navigation experiences.
- **Advanced Navigation Guards**: Implements `router.beforeEach` guards to control access to routes based on authentication status and other criteria. This includes:
  - Redirecting unauthenticated users to the login page when accessing private routes.
  - Navigating to a specific route if the authenticated user lacks certain properties (e.g., no associated company or not active).
  - Handling cases where authenticated users attempt to access public pages.
- **Error Handling**: Captures and manages routing errors, such as failed chunk loading, and provides appropriate user feedback.

## Usage
Utilize the Router module for effective URL state management and to ensure secure and logical navigation across the different sections of your Vue.js application.
