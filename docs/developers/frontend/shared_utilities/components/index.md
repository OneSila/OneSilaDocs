# Components

This directory contains all shared Vue components used throughout the application. 
It's structured into several subdirectories, each housing a specific type of component.

## Directory Structure

- `atoms`: The basic building blocks of the UI, including buttons, icons, and input fields.
- `layouts`: Components responsible for structuring the layout of pages or sections within pages.
- `molecules`: More complex components that are made up of multiple atoms, like forms or data tables.
- `organisms`: The most complex components, which might contain multiple molecules and atoms, representing entire sections of the application.
