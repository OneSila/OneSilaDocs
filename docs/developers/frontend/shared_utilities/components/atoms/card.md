# Card

The Card component is a versatile UI element used for grouping and displaying content in a neat, card-like format. Itâ€™s especially useful for dashboard interfaces, information panels, or any scenario where discrete chunks of information need clear delineation.

## Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use the Card component in your Vue template:

```vue
// adjust the path to match the current file
import { Card } from "../../../../shared/components/atoms/card";

<template>
  <Card>
    <!-- Your content here -->
  </Card>
</template>
```

The Card component creates a `div` element with predefined styling for background, padding, and shadow, providing a consistent, clean look across your application.
