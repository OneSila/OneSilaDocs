# ColorPicker

The ColorPicker component allows users to pick a color. It’s a handy tool for applications that require color selection, like design tools or settings panels.

## Usage

Include the ColorPicker in your Vue component as follows:

```vue
  <ColorPicker v-model="selectedColor" />
```

Bind a color value using `v-model` to make the ColorPicker reactive. The user’s color selection will be stored in the `selectedColor` variable.
