# Icon

The Icon component leverages FontAwesome icons, providing a wide range of vector-based icons. This component is useful for adding intuitive, scalable icons to your application.

## Usage

Here's how you can use the Icon component:

```vue
<Icon name="check-circle" size="lg" />
```

Replace `check-circle` with any FontAwesome icon name. The `size` prop can be adjusted to scale the icon.
