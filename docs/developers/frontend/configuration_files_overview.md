# Vue 3 Project Configuration Files Overview

This documentation provides an in-depth overview of key configuration files in the OneSila Frontend Vue 3 project, explaining their roles and specifics.

## `apollo-client.ts`
Configures Apollo Client for GraphQL communication:
- Sets up HTTP and WebSocket links for handling different types of GraphQL operations.
- Uses `onError` link to centrally handle GraphQL errors, like redirecting to login on authentication errors.
- Employs split links to appropriately direct queries/mutations and subscriptions.
- In development mode, it uses a `NoOpCache` to avoid caching issues.

## `components.d.ts`
A TypeScript declaration file, part of Vue's powerful composition API and TypeScript integration. It globally registers commonly used components to be available across the entire app, particularly to facilitate flex layouts. While this enhances code reusability and reduces imports, it's important to use this feature judiciously to avoid performance issues. Overusing global component registration can lead to increased memory usage and slower application startup times, as all registered components are loaded regardless of whether they are used.

In this project, we are specifically using it for `Flex` and `FlexCell` components from the shared components library, primarily to assist with flex layouts.

## `app-setting.ts`
Central configuration script that initializes the application's settings:
- Reads and applies user preferences from local storage or defaults from `$themeConfig`.
- Covers a broad range of settings including theme, layout, language, RTL support, and animations.
- Implements a method to change the application language dynamically.

## `postcss.config.js` and `tailwind.config.js`
Configuration for PostCSS and Tailwind CSS to style the application:
- `postcss.config.js` includes essential plugins for CSS processing.
- `tailwind.config.js` extensively customizes Tailwind CSS, tailoring it to the appâ€™s design requirements. It includes theming, typography, and custom utility classes.

## `theme.config.ts`
The primary configuration file for UI theming:
- Defines defaults for layout, theme, RTL support, and other UI aspects.
- Acts as the centralized theme management tool for the application.

## `tsconfig.json`
Configures TypeScript in the Vue project:
- Specifies compiler options like ECMAScript target, JSX preservation, and module resolution.
- Ensures type safety and enhances the development experience with strict type-checking.

These configuration files collectively ensure that the OneSila Frontend application is robust, maintainable, and customizable, following modern web development best practices.

## `App.vue`
The root Vue component orchestrating the entire application. It incorporates router and internationalization setup, authentication checks, and layout components. Here's a breakdown of its key aspects:
- Uses `vue-router` for page routing and `vue-i18n` for internationalization.
- Imports `injectAuth` from the shared auth module to manage authentication state.
- A reactive `sidebar` variable toggles the sidebar visibility.
- Dynamically updates the document title in development mode.
- Defines the main template structure with a conditional display of `SideBar` and `HeaderBar` based on authentication status.
