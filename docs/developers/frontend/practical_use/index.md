# Practical Use

## Overview
The Practical Use section of the documentation provides real-world application examples and configurations for various components within the Vue.js application. This section illustrates how individual modules, components, and plugins are integrated and utilized in different contexts, such as form handling, list generation, and data display.

### Key Pages
- **Form Page**: Demonstrates the implementation and customization of forms using the `GeneralForm` component, including dynamic field configurations and backend integration. [More details](./form_page.md)
- **List Page**: Showcases the usage of the `GeneralListing` component to create interactive and dynamic listings, integrating search, filtering, sorting, and pagination functionalities. [More details](./list_page.md)
- **Show Page**: Focuses on the `GeneralShow` component, explaining how to display detailed information about a particular item or entity, and how to configure fields for display. [More details](./show_page.md)

## Usage in Context
Each sub-application within the core application, such as 'People' or 'Companies', utilizes specific configurations for forms, listings, and show pages. These configurations, defined in each application's `config.ts` file, show the behavior and appearance of the components to meet the unique requirements of different parts of the application.

### Key Configuration Files
- Form Configurations: `/core/contacts/people/configs.ts`
- Routes Configuration: `/core/contacts/routes.ts`

### Route Integration
Each application also includes its `routes.ts` file, defining Vue Router paths and associated components. These routes are integrated into the main application's routing module, allowing seamless navigation between different parts of the application, such as 'Contacts', 'Sales', 'Purchasing', etc.

## Practical Application
The practical use cases provided in this section are derived from real-world examples and are designed to offer insights into how various components can be configured and used effectively in a production environment. They serve as a bridge between theoretical knowledge and practical implementation, illustrating how the components and modules documented elsewhere can be put to use in actual application scenarios.
